# SecureMe

## Project Overview

SecureMe is a comprehensive cross-platform security auditing tool designed to provide detailed insights into system security posture through automated scanning and analysis. Built in Python, this modular security suite performs in-depth assessments of software installations, hardware/firmware configurations, and network services to identify potential vulnerabilities and security risks.

## Core Features

**Software Analysis**: Detects and catalogs installed software packages across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms using native package managers, registries, and system APIs. Capable of identifying 700+ software installations including applications, utilities, and system components.

**Hardware & Firmware Scanning**: Comprehensive hardware inventory and firmware version detection covering BIOS/UEFI, motherboards, storage devices, network adapters, and graphics hardware. Provides critical firmware version information for security patch management.

**Network Security Assessment**: Advanced port scanning and service discovery functionality that identifies listening services, maps processes to network ports, and performs security risk assessment. Detects database services, file sharing protocols, application servers, and system services with process-level attribution.

## Architecture

The tool employs a modular design with platform-specific implementations ensuring optimal compatibility and performance across different operating systems. Each module provides unified interfaces while leveraging native system tools and APIs for accurate data collection.
